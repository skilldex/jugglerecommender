	Likes:
		-customizable graph
		-color gradient
	Confusions:
		-where to find videos since most only have gifs
	Suggestions:
		-show trick propup when selected in list to save a click
		-filter for type of video(maybe contributor filter handles this though)
		-a way to submit tutorials/breakdowns like jugglinglibrary
		-a way to submit descriptions that can be edited until a great explanation is given
			-maybe a comment section is good enough for this where people could also put advice, common mistakes, things to avoid

	Observations:
		-adblocker keeps video from playing
	Suggestions:
		-"Might be helpful to have a bigger color spectrum for difficulty if you want to include 5b 	Mills Mess siteswaps or 6b Mills mess"
		Difficulty ideas:
			-average number of user submitted catches

From discussion with lucasadverse: (6/24)
	-#b should go before trick not after (#b) since the ... pretty much always hides it until they click
	-no need to have 3b before tricks, that is assumed
	-request for facebook videos
	-request for loop small sections of youtube videos since lots of his tricks live there in bigger videos
	-request for loop smaller sections of ig videos
	-request for suggest info change of other users tricks

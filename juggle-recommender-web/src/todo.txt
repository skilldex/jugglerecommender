v3.6
	Profile Screen: (Larger section below)
		-upload image
			ian has code for this

=========

minor todos:
	-if there is 1 item in an autocomplete list, enter should select that item
	-on mobile the back arrow is not lined up with the word 'back'
		-on PC stats back arrow/word alignment is different than details and profile, but not sure which is better aligned
	-clicking tags/contributors inputs in filter should show all
		-right now this happens when just a single character is input, not on click

todos:
	-make autocomplete search match words individually instead of as solid strings
	-show preview in add trick form so it is easier to get time ranges for instagram/youtube videos
	-ability for users to suggest tags like they can relationships
	-multiple videos for a pattern/skill
		-a user can upload a video through a link for an existing trick and that video
			would show in an expandable list of user videos for that trick.
		-user voting ranking to float best video to top and be main video.
	-Comma separated tutorials
		-this means we need multiple tutorial inputs in form
	-chart of personal improvement over time, like number of patterns/skills improved per day
	

Bigger todos:
	-Make skilldex template for other skills
	-reintroduce graph
	-Make a wanted list
	-get a way to ignore particular users(mods) in GA
		-last attempt was with 'modignore' setup currently in code, but it didnt work and so is currently turned off just by having no names in code

For general skilldex:
	-an alternative to catches, maybe a personal rating system of goodness

Discuss:
	-user emails on github
	-make a possible duplicate section when a trick is submitted if there is another trick very similarly named, tagged, ballnumber..
	-possibly make catches able to be input from list (requested by ilia)
	-in ga, pageviews are sometimes way lower than events, right now it is 100:10
	-Stefan suggested we do suggestions for tags and siteswap like we did relateds
	-bluring small trick list should make them go away and clicking on the input should bring them back. I had it hooked up, but realised that expand broke it.
	-if difficulty filters are set on main pattern list, then difficulties higher than that in details become black
		-maybe this is ok, it shows that they are higher than is set in filter, if we ignore filter here then it may be confusing 
	-GA hooked up to browser back button? our back button? Seperate GAs or same?
	-Patterns mentioned in comments could be links
	-should flair filters require all selected flairs or any of the selected flairs?
	-make a 'tricks being worked on stat'?

Bugs:
	-in add trick form, expanding tricks on multiple (smalltrickslist)related lists messes up demos 
	-if we load page with filter url that results in no matches, we get endless loading wheel
	-if a trick with lots of relationships is edited it runs for a while and then crashes, seems like the edit worked after refresh though. Sometimes it says it is not responding, but then starts responding if you wait.
	-Scrolling is weird on add trick form, it is like there are two scrollbars and 1 only 		works on green part of form
	-catchCount slowly gets off over time, dunno why
	-When multiple relationships are edited out it doesn't get rid of the equivalents
		-this is very minor because multiple relationships are not often edited out at the same time
	-it occasionally gives a false 'video removed' message, or maybe it just gives it temporarily on slow connections
	VIDEO BUGS:
	-if an instagram is using time ranges, slowmotion doesnt stay when it loops forward
	-after about 10 loops, videos get stuck with loading wheel,
		/detail/Claymotion%20Overarm%20Orbits  is a quick looper
	-youtube slowmo back causes glitch if details page changes
	-youtube slowmo back doesnt loop
	-frame by frame doesnt hide controls for youtube
	-instagram videos clicked in tricklist open up their detail page, youtube videos do not, the video on homescreen also does not.


Niceties:
	-autoscroll to voted on card and make it flash when it re-sorts
		-would be nice if it animatedly moved
		-https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27198479/whats-a-react-js-friendly-way-to-animate-a-list-reordering/31080050
	-see if vote thumb can change colors quicker, maybe before work is done.
		-maybe see if can be done locally if it currently is waiting on db
	-showing the GA map in about or stats or something would be cool	
	-maybe share tap target should be made larger?
		-which share button having issues with?
	-maybe up arrow button that appears on list to zoom to top
	-there should be a way to add gifs even if pattern name is not a siteswap
	-An easy way to combine 2 patterns(just for mods)
		-for instance, Takeouts(4b) and Takeout Multiplex(4b) is the same trick, just one is LOJ, and one is juggling_vegan. Weave and The Weave is another
	-SORT BY:
		-view count, or users working on 
			-maybe not since views are not shown on cards, but maybe this isnt a big deal
	-a way to make playlists, or practice plans, would be nice to keep track of all the tricks of a kind that i want to work on consistantly
		-User made lists for things like 'patterns where all 3 balls line up vertically' or 'easy uncommon patterns' or 'easy to do hard to figure out' or 'hard to do, easy to figure out' or 'tjthejuggler's 5b cascade warmpup'
	-A wanted list where people can post tricks they would like to have
		-this could be not limited to tricks, but also info on existing tricks
		-wanteds posted by users with accounts only, or the ones with accounts float to top of list

Code Cleaning:
	-consolidate 'sortRootTricks' in utilities into several smaller functions
	-all those setStates in addTrickForm in componentdidmount, if (editing trick) may be redundant
		-when I comment them out I get the 'pattern already exists' message, so not redundant, but i don't understand why, it seems like we re-set state at the end of that function anyways.
	-how can the timeout in details.suggestRelationClicked() be removed?
	-randomleaderboardtrick could have its name changed to trickOfTheDay or something like that, as well as surrounding variables since it really now has different functionality
	-break up main render function in details.js
	-get add trick can submit checker split into multiple functions
	-clean up any trace of allTricksList/myTricksList
		-uiStore.updateRootTricks still has something of this
	-can detail and filter timers now be removed since they are their own screens?
	-do the spacing in addTrickForm without using "\u00A0"
	-in addTrickForm there are lots of functions that look like handleDiffChange, they can probably be 1 function
	-updateGraphData seperated into small functions
	-trick of the day made cleaner now that it isnt so much focused on leader
	-in filterStore these functions have similar functions that could prolly be combined: 		setTags
		handleDelete
	-find highest catches should be only run when it is actually used
		-is this still a thing?
	-Updateroottricks is running more than it needs to maybe
		-this may no longer be a thing
	-updateroottricks gets run when a trick is clicked on the list(probably any time details is entered into)

Performance Improvement:
	-when we go to a details page of a youtube trick, we get a firebase warning about adding security rule to increase performance
	-if home page stats are calculated on startup, switch to keeping running totals so it loads faster
		-check to see if tricklist or library load on home screen
	-if inside of each tricks info we keep track of all users that have that trick as a myTrick, then when a trick name changes we can more quickly update everyone's database.
